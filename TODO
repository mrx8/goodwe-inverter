complete refactor:
- define every single register with address and length in an individual stamp
- the stamps register the address in a registerManager which araranges requests from a register offset to a maximum of 125 registers (more is apparently not possible via UDP)
- test if multiple requests could be done parallel. If not do it sequential.
- update() method to fetch all data.
- all fields are configured in inverter.mjs
