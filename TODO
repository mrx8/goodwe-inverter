future complete refactor (only for better code, functionality remains the same):
- define every single register with address and length in an individual stamp
- the stamps register the address in a registerManager which araranges requests from a register offset to a maximum of 125 registers (more is apparently not possible via UDP)
- test if multiple requests could be done parallel. If not do it sequential.
- update() method to fetch all data.
- all fields are configured in inverter.mjs
- poll every 10s of all registers and signal on ready => data can then be read.

47546 FastChargeStopSoc RW U16 1 1 [0,100] => SoC at which charging is stopped: always at least current SoC + 2 or you will get ILLEGAL_DATA_VALUE.
