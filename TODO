complete refactor:
- define every single register with address and length in an individual stamp
- the stamps register the address in a registerManager which araranges requests from a register offset to a maximum of 125 registers (more is apparently not possible via UDP)
- test if multiple requests could be done parallel. If not do it sequential.
- update() method to fetch all data.
- all fields are configured in inverter.mjs
- poll every 10s of all registers and signal on ready => data can then be read.

write-support
- for battery-DOD for setting this to 100 if battery should not be discharged and 10 if battery should be discharged. usefull when charging BEV in winter.
